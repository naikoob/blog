Yay! So I switched job and got a new MacBook Pro. Good excuse to refresh my development (and terminal) setup. I have been using bash along with completion and git-prompt for as long as I can remember, this time I decided to cast my net wider and see what that world has been up to since I last spend time on this.

== zsh, prezto
I'm sticking to https://www.iterm2.com/[iTerm2, window='_blank'] as my preferred terminal application. As for the shell, I decided to take a look at zsh, seeing that it's now the default shell with MacOS Catalina. I also wanted capabilities such as auto-completion, git integration - without a lot of effort ;-). After a bit of googling and reading, I picked https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto[prezto, window='_blank'] as my zsh configuration framework.

== installing the tools
Installing iterm2 is simple with https://brew.sh/[homebrew, window='_blank']:
[source]
----
brew cask install iterm2
----

Zsh that comes with MacOS Catalina is quite current (v5.7.1), so I'll just use the OS supplied version. 

Next, install prezto with the following commands:
[source]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"
----
Alternatively, you can install from my fork which contains my modified theme:
[source]
----
git clone --recursive https://github.com/naikoob/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"
----

followed by 
[source]
----
setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
  ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
done
----

== tinkering 
First, edit the modules section of `~/.zpreztorc` to enable the desired modules. I've added a couple of modules as highlighted below:

[source]
----
# Set the Prezto modules to load (browse modules).
# The order matters.
zstyle ':prezto:load' pmodule \
  'environment' \
  'terminal' \
  'editor' \
  'history' \
  'directory' \
  'spectrum' \
  'utility' \
  'ssh' \ <1>
  'completion' \
  'git' \ <2>
  'syntax-highlighting' \ <3>
  'history-substring-search' \ <4>
  'prompt'
----
<1> useful if you have passphrase protected your keys and/or often ssh over a bastion hosts
<2> shows git information on your prompt
<3> eh... syntax highlighting? Well, actually this also does syntax checking as you type
<4> enable searching through command history using `ctrl-r`

== themes
tbh, this is a key motivation for me to explore prezto... The fancy prompt don't make me a better developer, but it sure makes me look the part ;-)

This is how my prompt looks like:

image::zsh-prompt.png[prompt]

It's based on the paradox theme that comes with the prezto distribution, and available on my fork https://github.com/naikoob/prezto/blob/master/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_doxxed_setup[here, window='_blank']

To use this theme, copy it to `~/zprezto/modules/prompt/functions/prompt_doxxed_setup`, and edit `~/.zpreztorc` like so:
[source]
----
# Set the prompt theme to load.
# Setting it to 'random' loads a random theme.
# Auto set to 'off' on dumb terminals.
zstyle ':prezto:module:prompt' theme 'doxxed'
----

== nerd fonts and glyphs
Notice the branch and chevron symbols in the screenshot above? Those are not in the standard character set, we need a patched/nerd font so that they display properly. You can find patched fonts https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts[here, window='_blank'] or  https://github.com/powerline/fonts[here, window='_blank']. I use the MesloLGS font from https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Meslo/S[here, window='_blank']. Just download and install the .ttf files.

If you're only using zsh from iTerm2 exclusively, you can skip the fonts and just enable built-in Powerline glyphs in iTerm2, like so:

image::iterm2-glyphs.png[]

And while you're at it, you can change the colour presets as well. I'm using 'Tango Dark' for the screenshot above.

image::iterm2-colorpreset.png[]

I use iTerm2's built-in glyphs in iTerm2 as I feel they render better, and patched/nerd font in Visual Studio Code terminals. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this setup. Hope you find it useful too.

It is a good practice to organise AWS workloads in multiple accounts, be it for security, accounting, or just to maintain our sanity. Here is how I work with multiple accounts in my AWS Organization from the command line.

== account(s)
Why does AWS encourage multiple accounts setups (apart from getting customers further entrenched on the platform)? This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxo67UeeN1A&feature=youtu.be&t=320[video, window='_blank'](3:20-7:00) gives a good explanation.

As for me, I'm organising my demos and PoCs in a separate `Demo` account. This way, I can share admin access to my demos with my colleagues without exposing my main account. In addition, I'm also centralising all IAM users in my main account, and access my `Demo` (and other accounts) by switching (assuming) roles. For readers new to this setup, I suggest this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html[tutorial].

In my `Demo` account, I create `DemoAdminRole` role, with the following trust policy to allow users from my main account to assume this roles:
[source, json]
----
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<MAIN_ACCOUNT_NUM>:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
----

In my main account, I created proxy roles that do not have any permission, other then to assume roles in my `Demo` account, with policy that looks like this:
[source, json]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<DEMO_ACCOUNT_NUM>:role/<DEMO_ROLE_NAME>"
    }
}
----

I can then attach this role to users that I want to grant access to my `Demo` account.

Finally, to prevent creation of users and access keys in the `Demo` account, I attached a service control policy like so to my `Demo` account:
[source, json]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Statement1",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateUser",
                "iam:CreateAccessKey"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
----

== profiles, profiles
AWS CLI and SDKs make use of `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` to manage AWS profiles and credentials. My `~/.aws/config` file looks like this:
[source]
----
[profile demo]
region=ap-southeast-1
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::<DEMO_ACCT_NUM>:role/<DEMO_ROLE_NAME>
source_profile=demo

[profile main]
region=us-west-2
output=json
----

and `~/.aws/credentials` looks like this:
[source]
----
[demo]
aws_access_key_id     = <DEMO_PROXY_USER_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <DEMO_PROXY_USER_SECRET_KEY>

[main]
aws_access_key_id     = <MAIN_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <MAIN_SECRET_KEY>
----

== switching between profiles
I deliberately not have a default profile to reduce the chance of targeting my scripts and ansible playbooks at the wrong profile. Instead, I added the following.footnote:[I got this off the Internet a while back, but can no longer find the source to give proper credit] to my `.zshrc` (and `.bashrc`) to allow me to quickly switch between profiles:

[source]
----
# working with AWS profiles
function _aws_list_all {
    credentialFileLocation=${AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE};
    if [ -z $credentialFileLocation ]; then
        credentialFileLocation=~/.aws/credentials
    fi

    while read line; do
        if [[ $line == "["* ]]; then echo "$line"; fi;
    done < $credentialFileLocation;
};

function _aws_switch_profile() {
   if [ -z $1 ]; then  echo "Usage: aws-profile profilename"; return; fi

   exists="$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id --profile $1)"
   if [[ -n $exists ]]; then
       export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=$1;
       export AWS_PROFILE=$1;
       export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region --profile $1);
       echo "Switched to AWS Profile: $1";
       aws configure list
   fi
};

alias aws-all="_aws_list_all"
alias aws-profile="_aws_switch_profile"
alias aws-whoami="aws configure list"

I can then switch profiles using the 3 aliases like so:

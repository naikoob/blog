So I tried Prezto for a couple of months as documented in my link:{% post_url 2020-06-10-my-terminal-setup %}[earlier post]. It works well except that it takes like 2 seconds to get my command prompt after opening a new terminal window (on a Macbook Pro 16). Not a deal breaker, but there must be something more efficient out there.

== powerline, dotfiles

Scouring through the Internet, I finally settled on writing (plagiarizing) my own zsh config files and https://github.com/powerline/powerline[powerline] (cos I still want a fancy prompt).

== stow

And then I found https://github.com/xero/dotfiles[this dotfiles project] on Github. It uses https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[GNU stow] to manage a hierarcy of dotfiles. The solution is so simple and elegant, it brings tears to my eyes.

== yay 
Here's my resulting https://github.com/naikoob/dotfiles[dotfiles repo]. I think it'll keep me happy for a while.

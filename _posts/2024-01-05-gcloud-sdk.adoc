In my link:{% post_url 2023-12-30-developing-on-wsl %}[previous post], I showed how I've setup my development environment on Windows with Visual Studio Code and Windows Subsystem for Linux. Here I'll document how to setup Google Cloud SDK in WSL environment.

== installing Google Cloud SDK on WSL

The default Linux distro for WSL is Ubuntu. Google Cloud SDK can be installed using Debian packages or Snap on Ubuntu. I'm using Debian packages because I'll be using `kubectl` to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

=== installation

Open a WSL terminal, and make sure package index are up-to-date with
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
----

Install some necessary packages to be able to download and add the Google Cloud deb repository keys
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg curl
----

Import the Google Cloud public key
[source,bash]
----
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg
----

Add the deb repository to the source list
[source,bash]
----
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
----

Install the CLI, and `kubectl` to work with Kubernetes clusters
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt install google-cloud-cli kubectl
----

=== configuration

Initialize the gcloud cli. 
[source,bash]
----
gcloud init
----

You'll be asked to login to your Google Cloud account. However, in WSL, there will not be a browser opened automatically. Instead, `ctrl-click` on the URL shown on the terminal window (something similar to below). To open the browser.

In the browser, sign in to Google Cloud account.

Upon successful login, the `gcloud init` commands will continue. Follow the prompts to select the Google Cloud project to use, as well as the default compute region and zone.

==== auto completion

Using the steps above, Google Cloud SDK will be installed in `/usr/lib/google-cloud-sdk`. In addition to that, there will be auto-completion scripts for `bash` and `zsh` installed in `/usr/share/google-cloud-sdk` directory, named `completion.bash.inc` and `completion.zsh.inc` respectively.

Depending on the shell you're using, just `source` the respective completion script in the shell rc script or on-demand. 

For Zsh, add the following to the `.zshrc` script.
[source,bash]
----
[[ -f /usr/share/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc ]] && source /usr/share/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc
----

*shameless plug*

Alternatively, my https://github.com/naikoob/dotfiles.wsl[WSL dotfiles repo] as shared in my link:{% post_url 2023-12-30-developing-on-wsl %}[previous post] has a Zsh configuration that includes `gcloud` auto-completion in addition to syntax highlighting and powerline integration.

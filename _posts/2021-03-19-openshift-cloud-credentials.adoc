I wrote about the AWS resources created by OpenShift installer in my link:{% post_url 2021-01-28-openshift-on-aws %}[earlier post]. In this post, let__'__s take a closer look at IAM credentials used by OpenShift on AWS.

== installation credentials

The simplest way to install OpenShift on AWS is to make use of the IPI (Installer Provisioned Infrastructure) method. With IPI, the installation process will provision a new VPC and other infrastructure resources, and then install OpenShift on top of it. It means that we need to use an account with the necessary privileges to create VPC, load balancers, etc for installation. We can use an adminstrator account for this, or, we can refer to the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html#installation-aws-permissions_installing-aws-account[documentation, window='_blank'] for more specific permission requirements.

I also have a ready to use policy file https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-openshift-install-policy-json[here (for OpenShift 4.7), window='_blank'].

Note that the credential used during installation is stored in your cluster as a Kubernetes secret named `aws-creds` in the `kube-system` namespace:

image::aws-creds.png[]

For OpenShift on AWS, we can delete this secret post installation. However, it will need to be reinstated when we need to perform cluster upgrades, as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.html#mint-mode-with-removal-or-rotation-of-admin-credential_manually-creating-iam-aws[documented here, window='_blank']. Alternatively, we can go into the AWS console and deactivate the corresponding access key and re-activate it when you want to perform a cluster upgrade.

== openshift created roles

As part of installation, OpenShift create roles for the bootstrap, master and worker nodes. The bootstrap role, and  https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-bootstrap-policy-json[associated policy, window='_blank'] is only used during the installation, and are deleted when the installation completes.

The master role's https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-master-policy-json[policy, window='_blank'] allows master nodes to configure load balancers as workload gets deployed/removed from the cluster, while the https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-worker-policy-json[worker policy, window='_blank'] only allows the worker nodes to retrieve it's own metadata, and region information.

These roles do not have any IAM permissions, and therefore are not able to create or modify access rights.

== cloud credentials operator (cco)

Post installation, OpenShift interacts with the underlying cloud infrastructure provider to perform operations such as provisioning additional worker nodes, or configure load balancers as workloads get provisioned and orchestrated on the platform. To do this, OpenShift needs the necessary perimissions on the underlying infrastructure. The https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/about-cloud-credential-operator.html[Cloud Credential Operator, window='_blank'] (CCO) is responsible for managing these credentials. The CCO operates on `CredentialsRequest` custom resource, and behaves differently based on the `credentialMode` setting.

=== cco modes
By default, CCO operates in the `Mint` mode. In this mode, CCO creates (mints) new credentials for components in the cluster. This allows it to create credentials with very specific permissions for the requesting component. However, this also means you need to provide an account with rights to create IAM users and roles to the CCO, which often raise concerns with enterprise security teams.

An alternative is the `Manual` mode, where the CCO takes a backseat and user has to manage all the different credentials used by OpenShift. For version 4.7 of OpenShift, there are 5 credentials to manage as described in my link:{% post_url 2021-01-28-openshift-on-aws %}[previous post].

A third, `Passthrough` mode, is available for OpenShift on AWS since version 4.5.8. In this mode, a single IAM credential with permissions to perform the different cluster functions is used for all components. Crucially, there are no permission to create or modify IAM configuration when using `Passthrough` mode, which should set security team at ease.

=== credentials request

`CredentialsRequest` is a custom Kubernetes resource (CRD) that describes the desired state of cloud credentials. Using the OpenShift command line client, we can obtain the `credentialsRequest` for the target cloud like so (version 4.7.2 on AWS):

You'll see that five(5) `credentialsRequest` will be created for OpenShift on AWS.

=== mint mode

When operating in `Mint` (the default) mode, the Cloud Credentials Operator creates an IAM user of each `credentialRequest`.

In addition, a Kubernetes secret containing the AWS access keys will be created and managed by the operator based on the `spec/secretRef` section of the `credentialsRequest`.

To illustrate, the following users are created when I install OpenShift using `Mint` mode:

Let's examine the `credentialsRequest` for the ingress operator:

      - tag:GetResources
      effect: Allow
      resource: '*'
  secretRef: <2>
    name: cloud-credentials
    namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
----

<1> specifies the required permission, this will be defined as inline policy for the IAM user
<2> specifies the namespace and name of the corresponding secret that will contain the access keys to this user

=== manual mode

In `Manual` mode, the user manages the cloud credentials instead of the Cloud Credentials Operator. This means we need to create the IAM users with the permissions as specified in the `credentialsRequest` above, along with the access keys and secrets during installation by following the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.html#manually-create-iam_manually-creating-iam-aws[instructions here, window='_blank'].

We also should reconcile the permissions with `credentialsRequests` of target versions before performing cluster upgrades.

=== passthrough mode

In `Passthrough` mode, the Cloud Credentials Operator does not create IAM users. Instead, the secrets contains the same AWS access keys used during installation. To rotate the access key, we update the `aws-creds` secret in the `kube-system` namespace. The CCO will they sync the other credential secrets with the same access keys specified in the `aws-creds`.

This implies that all the different components will be using the same credentials. Hence, the supplied credentials needs to have all the permissions requested by all the `credentialsRequest`.

Note also that by default, `kube-system/aws-creds` contains the access keys used during installation, which contains permissions that are not required during normal operations in `Passthrough` mode, such as creating IAM users. To mitigate this, we can create 2 separate policies for https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-openshift-install-policy-json[installation, window='_blank'] and https://gist.github.com/naikoob/d9d3d0a866d02ea485a4a988e7428acd#file-openshift-ops-policy-json[operations, window="_blank"]. 

Attach both policies to the user during installation. 

image::dual-policy.png[]

Once installation is complete, remove the `openshift-install-policy` from the user. 

Alternatively, we can create a separate IAM user for operation, and change the `kube-system/aws-creds` secret to use the operation account post installation.

In my (albeit limited) testing, we can perform cluster upgrades with just the operations policy attached with `Passthrough` mode, although it is prudent to review the `credentialsRequest` for the target version for any change in permissions.

== which option's for me?

So which option should we take?

`Mint` mode offers the most convenience from operations point of view. However, I recommend that you delete/deactivate the `kube-system/aws-cred` access keys post installation, and only re-instating them when performing cluster upgrades.

`Manual` and `Passthrough` modes are suitable for organizations that have an established process of managing IAM credentials. In this case, I suggest extending that process to include creating/rotating of credentials secrets. When using `Passthrough` mode, it's a good idea to remove the IAM creation permissions during normal operations as described above.

Finally, do consider configuring https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-alerts-when-your-iam-configuration-changes/[alerts for changes to IAM configuration, window='_blank'].

== what's next?

We'll be able to use short lived tokens instead of access keys soon with https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-mode-sts.html[manual mode using STS (Secure Token Service), window='_blank']. This should improve the security posture and is currently in Technology Preview. I'll look into this operating mode in a future article.
